# Enabled Automation-Rule Type Lookup

Which automation rule **types** are enabled on a set of campaigns:

```json
{
  "profileIds": [4404871489220462],
  "entity": "automationRule",
  "filters": {"amazonCampaignId": {"in": [123456789, 987654321, 555555555]}},
  "userContext": "Which automation rules are enabled on these campaigns"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "isError": false,
  "toolName": "get_entity_metadata",
  "data": {
    "rows": [
      {"amazonCampaignId": 123456789, "enabledRuleTypes": [2, 4], "enabledRuleNames": ["Dayparting", "Harvest Keywords"]},
      {"amazonCampaignId": 987654321, "enabledRuleTypes": [], "enabledRuleNames": []},
      {"amazonCampaignId": 555555555, "enabledRuleTypes": [17, 19], "enabledRuleNames": ["Budget Performance", "Placement Rule"]}
    ],
    "rowCount": 3
  },
  "meta": {"effectiveProfileIds": [4404871489220462]}
}
```

Notes:
- `amazonCampaignId` in `filters` is **required** for this entity — there is no way to list all campaigns' rules without specifying which campaigns.
- No `orderBy`/`page`/`pageSize` effect — results always come back in the order the campaign IDs were requested.
- An empty campaign in the response (`enabledRuleTypes: []`) means that campaign simply has no automation rules enabled, not an error.
- This response is only an enabled-type summary. It cannot answer "show the rule's conditions/actions/frequency/template name" or list the account's automation templates.
- For a managed group's embedded Rule-mode configuration, query `entity: "aiGroup"` and read `aiAutomation.{ruleType}` using [`automation-rule-reading.md`](automation-rule-reading.md).
- Product inventory rules are SKU/product-scoped and are not represented by this campaign lookup; do not infer their absence from an empty `enabledRuleTypes` array.
