# AI personality: per-action-space, and the legacy group-level field

Two kinds of account exist. The write tools decide which one you are on **at call time**, you
cannot switch an account through them, and the schema and descriptions are identical for
both - only the server's response differs.

**A read can tell you, in one direction.** `get_entity_metadata(entity='aiGroup')` on an
account that sets personality per action space returns the 12 `*AiPersonality` fields inside
`aiActionSettings`, plus
`actionSpaceIntensitySummary` at the top of the row - `{"allSame": true, "intensity": N}` when
every space is on the same level, `{"allSame": false}` otherwise. Legacy accounts carry none of
these.

The companions are conditional, so do not expect them on every field: a `*Text` is derived
only when that field's value is an integer `1`-`5`, and a `*UpdatedAt` appears only when the
downstream supplied one. A missing companion says nothing about the personality itself.

- **Seeing them is proof**: that account sets personality per action space.
- **Not seeing them proves nothing.** The summary is only emitted when the row has at least
  one valid personality value, so a group whose personalities are all unset looks the same as a
  legacy one; a failed capability lookup also falls back to the legacy shape.

So on an **edit** - where you are reading the group first anyway - use that read. On a
**create** there is no group yet: read any existing `aiGroup` in the same profile (the
setting is per account, not per group), or simply send the form you intend and let an
`invalid_params` rejection tell you - it happens before anything is written.

⚠️ On these accounts the group-level `aiPersonality` **is still returned by a read, but it is
read-only**. Seeing a number there is not permission to send it back.

| | Per-action-space accounts | Legacy accounts |
|---|---|---|
| How personality is set | 12 `*AiPersonality` fields inside `aiActionSettings` | one group-level `aiPersonality` |
| Group-level `aiPersonality` | **rejected** (any non-null value) | the supported group-level field - optional, omit it to leave the value unchanged |
| `operation: "aiPersonality"` (batch) | **rejected** | the way to do it |
| `operation: "actionSpaceIntensity"` (batch) | the way to do it | **rejected** |

Rejections happen **before any downstream call** and come back as `invalid_params`, which is
**not retryable** - fix the request rather than trying again. Omitting `aiPersonality` on an
edit is always fine: it is read as "no change", not as a value.

> **Naming.** The product calls this **AI personality** (AI 人格) everywhere, and so should you
> when talking to the user. The batch operation's literal value is nevertheless
> `actionSpaceIntensity` and the fields end in `AiPersonality` - send the literal strings
> exactly as written here; they are API values, not product terms.

## The 12 fields

They sit **flat inside `aiActionSettings`**, not nested under the optimization node they belong
to. The node column only tells you which switch they modify.

| Field | Node | SB |
|---|---|---|
| `bidPerformanceAiPersonality` | `bidOptimization` | supported |
| `bidDaypartAiPersonality` | `bidOptimization` | **not supported** |
| `bidAdPlaceAiPersonality` | `bidOptimization` | **not supported** |
| `bidAmazonBusinessAiPersonality` | `bidOptimization` | **not supported** |
| `structPauseProductAiPersonality` | `structOptimization` | **not supported** |
| `structPauseCampaignAiPersonality` | `structOptimization` | **not supported** |
| `budgetDaypartAiPersonality` | `budgetOptimization` | supported |
| `budgetDynamicAiPersonality` | `budgetOptimization` | supported |
| `budgetRedistributeAiPersonality` | `budgetOptimization` | supported |
| `targetHarvestAiPersonality` | `targetOptimization` | supported |
| `negativeTargetAiPersonality` | `targetOptimization` | supported |
| `targetPausedAddAiPersonality` | `targetOptimization` | **not supported** |

**Value: an integer `1`-`5`** (`1` = very conservative … `5` = very aggressive). **`null` is
rejected** (`invalid_params`), and **clearing a single action space is not supported at all** -
to leave one alone, omit the field. Anything else is rejected too, and the error lists **every**
invalid field at once, so read the whole list rather than fixing one and resending.

**Omit = keep unchanged** on a normal edit, and **omit = take the template's value** in template
mode. There is no payload that resets one action space to the group default.

⚠️ **On create, at least one intensity must be set.** An intensity-enabled account creating a
group (template create included) must end up with **at least one applicable field holding a
non-null `1`-`5` after the template is merged in**, or the request is rejected and the error
lists the fields applicable to that `campaignType`. Switch fields such as
`bidPerformanceStatus` do not count, and neither do nulls. So "the user didn't mention
personality" is not a reason to send none of them on a create - ask, or take the
recommendation (below), or use a template that carries them.

**Personality applies to `sponsoredProducts` and `sponsoredBrands` only.**

(SB's list is shorter because personality steers an **AI** decision: an action space SB runs
in Rule mode only - 分时调价 / `bidDaypart`, per `action-space-matrix.md` - has no AI decision
to steer, even though the switch exists. Capability and personality are separate questions.)

⚠️ **For an SB group, sending any of the six unsupported fields is rejected - whatever the
value.** Build the SB payload from the six supported ones and leave the rest out entirely.

**Omitted fields keep their current value on a normal edit.** (Template mode is different - see
below.)

## Setting one group

Put the fields you want in `aiActionSettings` of `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`, alongside the
switches:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "profileId": 1234567890123,
    "aiGroupId": 4567,
    "aiActionSettings": {
      "bidPerformanceAiPersonality": 4,
      "targetHarvestAiPersonality": 2
    }
  }
}
```

Do **not** add `aiPersonality` to that object on a per-action-space account - it is rejected
even when the rest of the request is valid.

## Setting many groups, or every action space at once

Batch is a different route: **inside a batch, personality fields in `aiActionSettings` are
rejected**. Use the operation instead.

```json
{
  "request": {
    "profileId": 1234567890123,
    "operation": "actionSpaceIntensity",
    "ids": [4567, 4568],
    "batchParams": { "actionSpaces": ["bidPerformance", "targetHarvest"], "intensity": 3 }
  }
}
```

- `actionSpaces` takes the action-space names **without** the `AiPersonality` suffix:
  `bidDaypart`, `bidPerformance`, `bidAdPlace`, `bidAmazonBusiness`, `structPauseProduct`,
  `structPauseCampaign`, `budgetDaypart`, `budgetDynamic`, `budgetRedistribute`,
  `targetHarvest`, `negativeTarget`, `targetPausedAdd` - or `["all"]` for all 12. Duplicates are
  ignored.
- `intensity` is an integer `1`-`5` and is **required**; `null` is rejected here as it is
  everywhere else. Nothing clears a personality - leaving an action space out of
  `actionSpaces` is how you leave it alone.
- Only the named action spaces are written; the rest of each group is untouched.
- Every id must be an SP/SB group of that profile.

⚠️ **`["all"]` plus any SB group in `ids` fails the whole batch**, because "all" includes the
six action spaces SB does not support. To set everything on a mixed selection, split it: `all`
for the SP ids, and the six supported names for the SB ids.

**To set every action space to the same level, this operation is the only way** - there is no
group-level shortcut on a per-action-space account.

## Template mode

Template mode (`templateId > 0`) works on both account types, with these differences on a
per-action-space account:

- Personality is written **field by field, user value over template value**. `null` is rejected
  here too: **omit a field to take the template's value**. There is no way to send a field
  that overrides the template with "nothing".
- **Template create does not write a group-level `aiPersonality`;** template edit keeps the
  group's current one. The template's own `aiPersonality` and the group-level defaults apply to
  legacy accounts only.
- Passing only personality fields in `aiActionSettings` **still applies the template's
  switches**. An empty `aiActionSettings` object behaves exactly like omitting it.
- For an SB group, the six SB-unsupported personalities in the template are **dropped
  automatically** - you do not have to clean the template first.
- **If a template personality that would be written is not an integer `1`-`5`, the request is
  rejected before anything is written.** Fix the template; re-sending will not help.
- Passing `aiPersonality` in template mode is rejected the same way as outside it.

## When the account check itself is unavailable

Any request carrying `aiPersonality`, any personality field, `operation: "aiPersonality"`,
`operation: "actionSpaceIntensity"`, or `templateId > 0` can fail with
**`capability_unavailable`**. That one **is** retryable: nothing was written, so resend the same
call later unchanged. Do not fall back to the other account type's syntax to "make it work" -
you would be guessing at which account you are on.

## Schedules take a different shape - do not copy the group payload

`save_sp_sb_ai_group_schedule` also carries personality, but **its `aiActionSettings` is not the
group's**. Four differences, each of which silently or loudly breaks a copied payload:

**1. Nested, not flat.** On the group the 12 fields sit directly in `aiActionSettings`. On a
schedule each one goes **inside the node it belongs to** - `bidOptimization`, `structOptimization`,
`budgetOptimization` or `targetOptimization` (the node column in the table above):

```json
"aiActionSettings": {
  "bidOptimization":    { "bidPerformanceAiPersonality": 4 },
  "budgetOptimization": { "budgetDaypartAiPersonality": 3 }
}
```

**2. Weekly schedules reject personality outright.** A `timeType: 2` item carrying any
`*AiPersonality` field fails the whole call:
`Weekly schedules (timeType=2) do not store action space intensity; remove <paths>`. Weekly
schedules inherit personality from the parent group - the same rule that already forbids
`aiPersonality` on them. (Items marked `operation: "delete"` are skipped by this check.)

**3. On a fixed-date schedule, omitting a field is not "keep what it had".** `timeType: 1`
**requires** `aiPersonality`, and that value is the fallback for every action space you do not
give an explicit `*AiPersonality`. So a personality you leave out **falls back to the
schedule's `aiPersonality`** rather than keeping its previous value - the opposite of the
group's edit semantics. Send the full set you want on that schedule, or read it back first and
re-send what should stay.

**4. Some nodes are stripped.** `targetOptimization` and `brandOptimization` (word-list
settings) are not configurable here and are dropped if sent - **except** the
`targetOptimization` personality fields, which are kept.

## Asking the platform what to set: `get_sp_sb_ai_personality_recommendation`

Read-only; it writes nothing. Available on **per-action-space accounts only** - a legacy account
is rejected with `invalid_params`, because it has no per-action-space values to recommend.

It covers **4 of the 12 action spaces**: `bidPerformance`, `bidAdPlace`, `targetHarvest`,
`negativeTarget`. The other eight are not recommended and are left alone.

**Two modes, and the parameters are mutually exclusive:**

**`profileId` is required in both modes**, and `language` is optional in both
(`zh` / `en` / `ja`, default `en`) - it sets the language of `summary`, so pass the language the
user is writing in rather than letting it default.

| Mode | Pass | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| Edit (`aiGroupId > 0`) | `profileId`, `aiGroupId`, optionally `language` - **any other parameter is rejected** | the group's latest stored recommendation (last 7 days) |
| Create (`aiGroupId` omitted or `0`) | `profileId`, plus `campaignIds`, `amazonCampaignIds`, `optimizeType`, `campaignType`; `targetAcos` and `language` optional | a recommendation computed in real time (takes a few seconds) |

In create mode, `campaignIds` and `amazonCampaignIds` must describe the **same** campaigns - get
both from `get_entity_metadata(entity='campaign')` - and `optimizeType` / `targetAcos` should be
the values you are about to pass to `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group`, or the advice describes a
group you are not creating.

**Read `adviceStatus` before using anything:**

| `adviceStatus` | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `VALID` | personalised recommendation | present it and let the user decide |
| `INVALID` | no personalised signal; every value is the default `3` | say it is the default, not a recommendation |
| `NO_ADVICE` | no data; every value is `null` | say there is no recommendation; change nothing |
| `ARCHIVED` | computed from a campaign / ASIN / targetType set the group no longer has | **tell the user it may be out of date before applying it** |

`recommendedIntensities` is keyed by the same field names as `aiActionSettings`, so values can
be copied across unchanged; each is `1`-`5` or `null` (no recommendation for that space). For an
SB group `bidAdPlaceAiPersonality` is simply absent. `summary` is the explanation to show the
user and is `null` for `INVALID` and `NO_ADVICE`. `evidence` says where each number came from:
`I1` this group's own manual operations, `I2` manual operations on campaigns sharing its ASINs,
`I3` / `I4` / `ACCOUNT` peer benchmarks, `P3` the default `3`.

**Applying it is a separate, user-approved step.** Show the recommendation, get an explicit yes,
then copy the **non-null** values into `aiActionSettings` on `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group` - the
same `aiGroupId` on edit, the same campaigns and `targetType` on create. Fields you do not
include keep their current values. A recommendation is not an authorisation to write.
