# Classification rules

Every rule here is mechanical. Apply it as code when you can (a reference script is at the
end); never adjust a label by judgement. Same input, same output.

## Inputs

- `TOTAL`: spend, sales, orders of all search terms (data-retrieval call 1).
- `ORDERING`: per search term, spend / sales / clicks / orders, orders > 0 (call 3).
- `ZERO_HIGH`: per search term, orders = 0 and spend >= `T` (call 4).
- `SOURCES`: per search term, the set of match types it had orders under (call 5).
- `EXACT`: enabled exact keywords (call 7); `EXACT_PERF`: their performance (call 8).
- `BRAND`: confirmed brand terms; `WHITELIST`: confirmed never-negate roots; `OWN_ASINS`.
- `TARGET_ACOS`: the confirmed store-wide target, else `TOTAL.spend / TOTAL.sales`.
- `TOTAL` is **one** object: call 1 returns a row per ad type - sum them first.
- `STAGE`: mature or new / launch - asked in Step 1, never inferred.
- `DAYS`: period length.

Units - one rule everywhere: **ratios are fractions inside the computation.** A customer's
"35%" and `get_ads_perf`'s `ACOS` value `35` both become `0.35`; `TOTAL.spend / TOTAL.sales`
already is one. Convert back to a percentage only when writing the answer. Mixing the two
inflates `T` a hundredfold.

Derived:

- `AOV` = `TOTAL.sales / TOTAL.orders`. If the period has no orders or no sales, stop: there is
  no order value or ACOS to derive thresholds from - say so instead of classifying.
- `T` (one order's target spend) = `AOV x TARGET_ACOS`.
- `SCALE` = `30 / DAYS`; order **thresholds** compare `orders x SCALE`. Whether a term has
  orders at all is always decided on the raw count.

## Three labels per search term

| Label | Values | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Entry | keyword / ASIN | ASIN when the whole term matches `^b0[0-9a-z]{8}$` (case-insensitive) |
| Brand | brand / non-brand | Keyword entry only. Brand when the term contains any confirmed brand term. A brand term written in Latin letters (accents, hyphens and apostrophes allowed) must match as a whole word or phrase - `pro` matches "acme pro filter", not "protein"; a brand term in another script matches as a substring, ignoring spaces |
| Order tier | core / potential / zero-high / zero-small | raw orders = 0: **zero-high** if spend >= `T`, else **zero-small** (not listed, see data-retrieval). Raw orders > 0: **core** if orders x SCALE >= 3, else **potential** |

## V1 - where the money goes

Spend, share of `TOTAL.spend`, orders and ACOS per tier, keyword and ASIN entry shown
separately; zero-small as one line with its amount. Then, as a separate line, the small
unconverted spend by source (data-retrieval -> the zero-order small terms) - a different,
finer measure; never present its shares as "the source of the zero-small terms". Description
only - a large long tail is not a finding on its own.

## V2 - brand vs non-brand

Keyword-entry terms in the listed tiers (core, potential, zero-high) - zero-small terms are
not listed, so they can't be tagged. Report the brand share **of the listed keyword spend**
(say it that way), brand ACOS, non-brand ACOS, and non-brand ACOS / brand ACOS. Direction, no
score:

- **Brand share high and non-brand ACOS several times brand**: a brand-led store. Ask what
  the customer wants - only to capture branded demand (defend brand terms), or to grow
  non-branded traffic (accept higher non-brand ACOS for a while).
- **Brand share low**: growth depends on non-branded traffic, so price and product decide;
  keep brand terms profitable, don't push volume there.

Skip V2 and say why when the customer gave no brand terms. Backtests showed the answer flips
with the brand list (5.6% with the brand name only vs about 27% with sub-brands added), so
never guess the list.

## V3 - zero-order waste, in three groups

**V3a - zero-order exact keywords → pause.** From `EXACT_PERF`: enabled exact keywords with raw
orders = 0 and their **own** spend >= `T`. Each row names the keyword, its campaign and its
`keywordId` (from call 7, joined on `amazonKeywordId`). Action: pause this keyword. No bid
advice.

**V3b - negative candidates.** Zero-high search terms, sorted by spend, minus:

- brand terms, own ASINs, terms containing a whitelisted root → **held back**, counted at the
  end ("品牌词 / 自家 ASIN / 白名单拦截 N 条");
- terms whose text equals an enabled exact keyword → group V3c.

Action: ASIN entry → negative product targeting; keyword entry → negative exact. Each row
also carries the campaign type, campaign and ad group the spend came from (call 10), which
decide how `sparkx-edit-ads` can add it (see SKILL.md Step 5).

**V3c - zero-order terms you also target as exact keywords.** The customer chose to target
these, so they are not proposed as negatives. Show where the zero-order spend came from (the
exact keyword itself, which V3a already covers when it crossed `T`, or other campaigns'
broad / phrase / auto); negating the term in those other campaigns is the customer's call.

Then the managed-group label (data-retrieval calls 10-12) on V3b rows: "托管组已开自动否定"
when every campaign the term spent in is in a group with automatic negative targeting on.
Labelled rows stay in the list.

**Root negation is optional** - only when the customer asks: a token that appears in at least
3 V3b keyword terms, never in any ordering keyword term, with combined spend >= `T`, is a
phrase-negative candidate. In both backtest stores this produced nothing, so it is not a
default view.

Backtest (2026-10, store ACOS as target): manual store - V3a 9 keywords ($238), V3b 175
terms ($3,102), V3c 11 terms ($190); AI-managed store - V3a 26 ($1,403), V3b 107 ($3,306),
V3c 61 ($2,800).

## V4 - harvest candidates

Keyword-entry terms where all of the following hold:

- orders x SCALE >= **4** when `STAGE` is mature, >= **2** when new / launch;
- ACOS <= `TARGET_ACOS`;
- the term had orders under an open match type (`LOOSE-MATCH`, `CLOSE-MATCH`, `broad`,
  `phrase`);
- the term is not already an enabled exact keyword;
- the term is not a pasted product title: more than 8 words or containing a comma.

Sort by orders. Mark brand terms (they go into a brand exact group). Add "托管组未开定向收割"
when the term's managed groups all have harvesting off.

## V5 - fragmented exact keywords

From `EXACT_PERF`, enabled exact keywords with orders x SCALE <= 3: count, how many have zero
orders, spend, and their share of all exact-keyword spend. Also say how many enabled exact
keywords had no data at all in the period: count **keyword entities** - `EXACT` rows whose
`amazonKeywordId` has no `targetId` in `EXACT_PERF` - not distinct texts (the same text often
exists in several ad groups).
Suggestion for mature products: fold them back into auto / broad and manage them there.

## Reference script

Inputs are the saved query results; output is the file the answer and export are built from.
Managed-group labels and the campaign / ad group of V3b rows are added afterwards from calls
10-12.
