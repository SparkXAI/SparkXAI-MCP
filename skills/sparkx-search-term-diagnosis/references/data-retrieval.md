# Data retrieval

One store, one period. Everything below was run against two production stores (2026-10,
read-only): a manual SP store with about 2,300 ordering search terms, and an AI-managed SP +
SB store. Call counts are from those runs.

## Three behaviours that decide how you query

1. **A metric used in `filters` must also be in `metrics`.** Filtering on `Conversions`
   without requesting it fails with `unknown field 'Conversions'`.
2. **Metric filters apply after grouping.** They filter the aggregated row of whatever you
   `select`. With `select: ["query_"]`, `{"Conversions": {"=": 0}}` means "search terms with
   no orders in total" - what you want. With `select: ["matchType_"]` it means "match types
   with no orders at all" and returns nothing. Choose `select` for the level you want to
   filter at.
3. **Normalise response keys before using them.** In live calls (2026-10) and in the server's
   column cleaner, rows come back without the entity prefix and the `_` suffix: `query_` ->
   `query`, `campaign.campaignId_` -> `campaignId`, `target.targetText_` -> `targetText`
   (plus `...Text` companions). Some base-skill examples show the requested form instead.
   Don't rely on either: map every key with "drop everything up to the last `.`, then drop a
   trailing `_`" once, right after each call, and use only the normalised names afterwards
   (the reference script expects them).
   `matchType` values seen: `LOOSE-MATCH`, `CLOSE-MATCH`, `SUBSTITUTES`, `COMPLEMENTS`
   (auto), `broad`, `phrase`, `exact` (keywords), `ASIN`, `CATEGORY` (product targeting -
   upper case).

Do not pass `queryType` on `factEntity: searchTerm`: omitting it is the only way to include
auto-targeting search terms.

## Narrowing the scope

Whole store by default. When the user names:

- **campaigns**: resolve them with `get_entity_metadata(entity='campaign')` (internal
  `campaignId` and `amazonCampaignId`). Add `{"campaign.campaignId_": {"in": [<Amazon ids>]}}`
  to every `get_ads_perf` call, including call 8, and `{"campaignId": {"in": [<internal
  ids>]}}` to call 7;
- **a product (ASIN or parent ASIN)**: there is no product dimension on search terms. Follow
  the base skill's three steps - `get_entity_metadata(entity='productAd')` filtered to the
  ASINs (expand a parent first via `entity='asin'`, `filters: {"parentAsin": ...}`) gives
  internal `adGroupId`s; `entity='adGroup'` maps them to `amazonAdGroupId`. Then filter
  **every** `get_ads_perf` call - the search-term calls and call 8 - on
  `{"p.adGroupId_": {"in": [<Amazon ad group ids>]}}`, and call 7 on
  `{"adGroupId": {"in": [<internal ad group ids>]}}`. Skipping the mapping step returns zero
  rows with no error; leaving call 7 or 8 unfiltered mixes the whole store's exact keywords
  into V3a, V3c, V4 and V5. Report the result as **search terms in the ad
  groups that contain this product**, not traffic attributed to the ASIN - an ad group usually
  holds several products.

Totals (call 1) use the same filter, so thresholds and shares are within the scope. Every
call in the plan below takes the scope filter, not only the search-term ones.

## Call plan

All `get_ads_perf` calls: `factEntity: "searchTerm"` unless noted, the same `dateStart` /
`dateEnd`, `pageSize: 500`, and **loop `page` while `meta.hasNextPage`**.

| # | Purpose | `select` | `metrics` | `filters` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Totals (and the average order value) | `["campaign.campaignType_"]` - one row per ad type; **sum the rows** into one total | `Spend, Sales, Clicks, Conversions` | - |
| 2 | Totals by source | `["matchType_"]` | same | - |
| 3 | Search terms with orders | `["query_"]` | same | `{"Conversions": {">": 0}}` |
| 4 | Zero-order terms above the threshold `T` | `["query_"]` | same | `{"Conversions": {"=": 0}, "Spend": {">=": T}}` |
| 5 | Source match types of ordering terms (harvest source, small-term split) | `["query_", "matchType_"]` | same | `{"Conversions": {">": 0}}` |
| 6 | Zero-order search-term x match-type rows at or above `T` (small-spend source split) | `["query_", "matchType_"]` | same | `{"Conversions": {"=": 0}, "Spend": {">=": T}}` |

`T` = one order's target spend = (`Sales` / `Conversions` from call 1) x target ACOS (as a
fraction - see classification.md -> Units). Calls
1, 3 and 9 run in Step 1, because the pre-filled store ACOS and brand candidates come from
them; calls 4, 6 and 8's V3a cut-off need `T`, so they run after the target ACOS is confirmed.

Order calls 3 and 4 by `Spend` descending so a partial run still holds the important rows,
but classify only on complete page sets.

Metadata (`get_entity_metadata`, page through `hasNextPage`):

| # | Purpose | Call |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | Exact keywords in use (harvest de-dup, V3a / V3c, V5) | `entity: "keyword"`, `filters: {"matchType": {"in": ["exact"]}, "keywordState": {"in": ["enabled"]}}`, `select: ["keywordId", "amazonKeywordId", "keywordText", "matchType", "campaignId", "adGroupId", "campaignType", "profileId"]` - names come from call 11 |
| 8 | Exact keyword performance (V3a, V5) | `get_ads_perf`, `factEntity: "target"`, `queryType: "keyword"`, `select: ["target.targetId_", "target.targetText_", "target.targetMatchType_", "target.targetState_", "target.campaignId_"]`, `metrics: ["Spend", "Sales", "Clicks", "Conversions"]`, `filters: {"target.targetMatchType_": "exact"}`. `targetId` is the Amazon keyword id - join to call 7 on `amazonKeywordId` to get the internal `keywordId` a pause needs |
| 9 | Brand pre-fill | `entity: "asin"`, `select: ["asin", "asinBrand", "asinTitle"]` |

Managed-group labels, only for the terms that end up in the V3 / V4 lists:

| # | Purpose | Call |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | Where each listed term's spend came from | `get_ads_perf`, `select: ["query_", "campaign.campaignId_", "campaign.campaignName_", "campaign.campaignType_", "adGroupId_"]`, `metrics: ["Spend", "Clicks", "Conversions"]`, `filters: {"query_": {"in": [...]}}` in batches of about 100 terms. If the `in` filter on `query_` is refused, pull the same `select` for the whole period instead (one AI-managed test store: 10 pages) |
| 11 | Campaign / ad group -> internal ids, names and managed group | `get_entity_metadata(entity='campaign')`, `select: ["campaignId", "amazonCampaignId", "campaignName", "campaignType", "profileId", "aiGroupId"]`; `get_entity_metadata(entity='adGroup')`, `select: ["adGroupId", "amazonAdGroupId", "adGroupName", "campaignId"]`. Search-term rows carry **Amazon** ids; join on the `amazon*Id` fields, comparing as strings (one side may be numeric). Whether an ad group can take a negative product target is checked by `sparkx-edit-ads` at write time - metadata has no targeting-type field to pre-check it |
| 12 | Group switches | `get_entity_metadata(entity='aiGroup')`: `aiActionSettings.targetOptimization.negativeTargetStatus` (`1` = automatic negative targeting on) and `targetHarvestStatus` (`1` or `2` = harvesting on) |

A term is labelled "托管组已开自动否定" only when **every** campaign it spent in belongs to a
group with that switch on; the same rule for harvesting.

## The zero-order small terms, and where small unconverted spend comes from

Two different measures - keep them apart, and name them differently to the customer:

- **Zero-order small terms (零单小词)** - search terms with no orders in total and spend below
  `T`. Amount = call 1 spend - call 3 spend - call 4 spend. This is the V1 line. Never
  listed.
- **Small unconverted spend by source (未出单的小额流量)** - measured one level finer, at
  search term x match type: the rows with no orders and spend below `T`. Per match type it is
  exactly (call 2) - (call 5) - (call 6); calls 5 and 6 work at that same level, so nothing
  is double-counted. It includes the zero-order slices of terms that did convert under another
  match type, so it is **not** "the source of the zero-order small terms": present it as its
  own line - "没出单的小额流量（按搜索词 × 匹配方式计）里，X% 来自 …" - with shares.

Use the source line to say **where to look**, not to prescribe a cut: harvest the good terms
from that match type, check its negatives, or split it into its own campaign to watch it. Do
not suggest pausing a match type on this number alone - it mixes in traffic from terms that
convert.

- **By campaign**: the same row-level measure needs search-term x campaign detail. Only give
  it when that detail was pulled anyway (e.g. as the fallback of call 10).

## Sanity checks

- Search-term spend (call 1) should be close to the spend of the same scope one level up:
  whole store -> `factEntity: campaign` with `{"campaign.campaignType_": {"in":
  ["sponsoredProducts", "sponsoredBrands"]}}` (search terms exist for SP and SB only, so SD
  must be left out); product scope -> `factEntity: adGroup` with the same `p.adGroupId_`
  filter. The test stores were at 99.5% and 99.8%. A large gap means a scope mismatch - say
  so.
- Call 3 must reproduce the total orders and sales of call 1 exactly (all orders sit on
  ordering terms).
- Volumes seen: 2,332 ordering terms (5 pages), 218 zero-order terms above `T`, 2,909
  search-term x match-type rows with orders (6 pages), 810 and 3,891 enabled exact keywords
  (2 and 8 pages). The manual store's full diagnosis took about 15 calls.
