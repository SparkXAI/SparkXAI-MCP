# Field Reference — `get_operation_log`

## Parameter Details

### entities

Entity types (use carefully):
- `campaign` - campaign
- `adGroup` - ad group
- `target` - targeting/keyword
- `placement` - ad placement
- `portfolio` - portfolio
- `profile` - store
- `aiGroup` - AI managed group
- `productAd` - product ad
- `audience` - audience targeting (excluded from the default "all entities" scan — must be requested explicitly)

**Important**: entities strictly filters only direct operations on that entity type.
- User says "what operations on this campaign" -> **do NOT** set entities
- User says "only campaign-level operations themselves" -> set `entities: ["campaign"]`
- Default (omitted) queries all entity types **except `audience`**

### resourceIds

Array, each item has `idEntity` (resource type) and `ids` (list of IDs):
```json
[
  {"idEntity": "campaign", "ids": [123456, 789012]},
  {"idEntity": "adGroup", "ids": [111222]}
]
```

**`idEntity` enum values**:
- `campaign` - campaign
- `adGroup` - ad group
- `keyword` - keyword
- `target` - targeting
- `placement` - placement
- `aiGroup` - AI managed group
- `portfolio` - portfolio
- `productLine` - product line

**`idType` rule** (optional, auto-inferred if omitted):
- `amazon` (default): applies to campaign, adGroup, keyword, target, placement, portfolio — these use Amazon's own entity IDs
- `increment`: applies to aiGroup, productLine — these use SparkX AI's internal auto-increment IDs

```json
[{"idEntity": "aiGroup", "idType": "increment", "ids": [501, 502]}]
```

**Locating a resource by name first**: this tool takes IDs, not names. If the user describes an object by name (e.g. "campaign SP-T1 MAX-KW-Brands-solder", "keyword 'wireless earbuds' exact match"), first resolve it to an ID via `get_entity_metadata`:
- campaign name -> `entity: "campaign", filters: {"campaignName": {"like": "%...%"}}` -> `campaignId`
- keyword text + match type -> `entity: "target", filters: {"targetText": {"like": "%...%"}, "targetMatchType": "exact"}` -> `targetId`
- ASIN -> `entity: "productAd", filters: {"asin": "..."}` -> `amazonAdId` / `campaignId`

Then pass the resolved ID into `resourceIds`.

### campaignTypes

Campaign types:
- `sponsoredProducts` - SP ads
- `sponsoredBrands` - SB ads
- `sponsoredDisplay` - SD ads

### changeBy

Operator filter. Always pass an object with explicit `operator` and `values`:
```json
{"operator": "IN", "values": ["ai", "manual"]}
```
Use `"operator": "NOT_IN"` to exclude values instead.

Valid values:
| User says | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| AI | ai |
| Manual / user | manual |
| Automation rule | automation |
| AI custom rule | aiCustomRule |
| Budget management | budgetManagement |
| Lock ranking | lockRanking |
| Amazon console | amazonConsole |
| API | api |
| Labels | labels |
| System | system |
| Specific user | user email address (pass as one of the `values`) |

### actionType

Action type filter (coarse-grained, 14 categories). Always pass an object with explicit `operator` and `values`:
```json
{"operator": "IN", "values": ["Bid Increased", "Bid Decreased"]}
```

Valid values:
| User says | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Added / created | Added |
| Archived | Archived |
| Paused | Paused |
| Enabled | Enabled |
| Bid increased | Bid Increased |
| Bid decreased | Bid Decreased |
| Budget increased | Budget Increased |
| Budget decreased | Budget Decreased |
| Placement increased | Placement Increased |
| Placement decreased | Placement Decreased |
| Other field changes | Other Fields Changed |
| Bidding strategy | Bidding Strategy Setting |
| Abnormal status | Abnormal Status Changed |
| Bid adjustment setting | Bid Adjustment Setting |
| AI group setting changed | AI Group Setting changed |

### operationType

Operation type filter (fine-grained). More precise than `actionType`. Always pass an object with explicit `operator` and `values`:
```json
{"operator": "IN", "values": ["Campaign Paused", "DailyBudget Increased"]}
```

⚠️ **Only use the exact string values listed below.** Do not invent or guess values outside this table.

> **Rule variants:** only the budget-dayparting Rule string above is confirmed in a
> production log (2026-08-18). Do not construct or submit inferred Rule strings for
> other action spaces. Query with the broader `actionType` (or without an
> `operationType` filter), inspect the exact returned value, and only then reuse that
> observed string in a narrower follow-up query. `budgetRedistribute` and
> `bidAmazonBusiness` are `noRule` capabilities and have no Rule variant.

> **aiGroup action-space changeField values**: the `changeField` is the action-space
> switch name (e.g. `budgetDaypartStatus`, `bidAdPlaceStatus`). The `newValue`/
> `previousValue` encode the state:
>
> | Value | Meaning | operationType suffix |
> |---|---|---|
> | `0` | Off / disabled | "Disable ..." |
> | `1` | On, AI mode | "Enable ... (optimization method: AI)" |
> | `3` | On, Rule mode | Confirmed for budget dayparting; do not infer an exact `operationType` for other action spaces |
>
> Value `3` has been observed for budget dayparting. Treat it as a returned display
> value, not a direct write value, and do not generalize it to an unobserved action
> space without evidence from that action space's returned rows.

Use `actionType` for broad filtering; use `operationType` when you need precise control over specific entity+action combinations.

### targetTypes

Targeting type filter. Narrows target entity operations to specific targeting types.

Valid values:
- `product` - product targeting
- `keyword` - keyword targeting
- `automatic` - automatic targeting
- `category` - category targeting
- `theme` - theme targeting
- `keywordGroup` - keyword group
- `negativeKeyword` - negative keyword
- `negativeAsin` - negative ASIN
- `negativeBrand` - negative brand

### placementTypes

Placement type filter. Narrows placement operations to specific placement types.

**Complete enum — these 7 values**: `detailPageAdjustment`, `homeAdjustment`, `otherAdjustment`, `productPageAdjustment`, `restOfSearchAdjustment`, `siteAmazonBusinessAdjustment`, `topSearchAdjustment`. Do not guess at additional values or try to infer more from `changeField`.

⚠️ **These are the change log's own names and they do not all line up with the write tool's.** The log has `topSearchAdjustment`, which matches neither SP's `topAdjustment` nor SB's `topOfSearchAdjustment`. Use this list when filtering the log, and the placement-field table in `sparkx-edit-ads`'s `references/write-campaign.md` when writing — do not map a name from one onto the other.

### ChangeLogVO Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| entity | string | Entity type: `campaign`/`adGroup`/`target`/`aiGroup`/`portfolio`/`placement`/`profile`/`productAd` |
| entityName | string | Entity display name |
| amazonEntityId | long | Amazon-side entity ID |
| entityId | long | SparkX AI-side entity ID |
| operationType | string | Fine-grained operation type (e.g. `DailyBudget Increased`) |
| profileId | long | Profile ID |
| aiGroupName | string | AI managed group name (present on aiGroup-related logs) |
| amazonCampaignId | long | Amazon campaign ID — **this is the id to report** when the user asks for one; it is not the internal `campaignId` the write tools take |
| campaignName | string | Campaign name — **answer with this** unless an id was explicitly asked for (see `platform-notes.md` -> "Naming things in your answer") |
| campaignType | string | Campaign type |
| amazonAdGroupId | long | Amazon ad group ID (null if not applicable) |
| adGroupName | string | Ad group name (null if not applicable) |
| changeField | string | Which field changed |
| previousValue | string | Value before the change |
| newValue | string | Value after the change |
| countryCode | string | Country code |
| **currencyCode** | string | **Currency of this row's monetary change** (e.g. `"USD"`/`"JPY"`), mapped from `countryCode`. Always local currency — there is no cross-profile USD conversion for logs |
| createdDate | string | Operation timestamp, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. **⚠️ Timezone is not fixed** — `aiGroup` rows are UTC always; `campaign`/`adGroup`/`target`/`placement` rows are **store-local when you pass one `profileId`** and **UTC when you pass several**. Verified 2026-08 on a US (`America/Los_Angeles`) profile: the same pause record returned `2026-08-24 00:01:06` for one profileId and `2026-08-24 07:01:06` for two. Always label the zone, never merge single- and multi-profile results, and remember a mixed-entity response can contain both clocks in one time-sorted list (so it is not reliably chronological). See SKILL.md → "createdDate Timezone" |
| changedBy | string | Who made the change: `ai`/`manual`/`automation`/etc, or a user identifier |
| aiGroupScheduleId | long | Schedule ID (present on aiGroup-related logs) |
